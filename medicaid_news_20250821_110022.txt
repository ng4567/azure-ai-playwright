President Trump signed into law on July 4, 2025 a budget reconciliation package (formerly called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”) that will make significant changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that, relative to its estimates of insurance coverage prior to the law being enacted, the law will increase the number of people without health insurance in 2034 by 10 million, because of changes to Medicaid (7.5 million), the ACA Marketplaces (2.1 million), and other policies and interactions among different provisions (0.4 million). These legislative changes come at a time when enhanced premium tax credits for ACA Marketplace enrollees are set to expire later this year. When combining the impact of the reconciliation law with that of the expected expiration of the ACA’s enhanced premium tax credits, CBO estimates show that the number of uninsured people will increase by more than 14 million in 2034. That estimate does not account for the effects of the Trump administration’s ACA Marketplace Integrity and Affordability rule finalized earlier this year, so the overall change in the number of uninsured people could be even larger.

This analysis apportions the increase in the number of uninsured across the 50 states and the District of Columbia and shows that number as a percentage of each state’s population. The number of additional uninsured people as a percent of the population is equivalent to the percentage point increase in the 2034 uninsured rate. Nationally, CBO projected an uninsured rate of under 10% in 2034 under current law, which assumed the enhanced ACA premium tax credits would expire. The analysis here includes two maps: one showing the effects of the reconciliation law, and another showing those effects combined with expiration of the ACA enhanced premium tax credits. (The ACA Marketplace Integrity and Affordability rule is expected to contribute to increases in the uninsured, though estimates of the finalized rule have not been released by CBO.)

Anticipating how states will respond to changes in Medicaid policy is a major source of uncertainty in CBO’s cost estimates. Instead of making state-by-state predictions about policy responses, CBO estimates the percentage of the affected population that lives in states with different types of policy responses. For example, in the reconciliation law, Medicaid work requirements account for more than half of CBO’s estimated 2034 increase in the number of people without uninsurance because of changes to Medicaid. However, different states might choose to implement a work requirement with reporting requirements that are easier or harder for enrollees to comply with. Reflecting the uncertainty, this analysis illustrates the potential variation by showing a range of enrollment effects in each state, varying by plus or minus 25% from a midpoint estimate.

The interactive table at the end is sortable by state and size of increase in the uninsured rate.

Relative to current law, the reconciliation law is estimated to increase the uninsured rate by 3 percentage points or more in 20 states (Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia) and the District of Columbia. These increases are attributable to the reconciliation law alone and do not include the effects of the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits or the proposed Marketplace integrity rule.

In terms of increases in the number of uninsured people, California and New York are the top two states (1.6M and 860k, respectively). Florida, Texas, and Illinois would follow at 590k, 480k, and 470k, respectively.

The combined effects of the budget law and the expiration of the ACA enhanced tax credits, compared to a scenario where the enhanced subsidies are in place, results in the greatest increases in Louisiana, Florida and Arizona, where the uninsured rate is expected to increase by at least 5 percentage points. In 34 states and the District of Columbia, the uninsured rates could be 3 percentage points or more higher than would otherwise be the case.

About half (49%) of the 14.2 million more people who would be uninsured in this scenario live in California (1.7M), Florida (1.5M), Texas (1.4M), New York (860k), Illinois (520k), Georgia (500k) and Ohio (460k). The largest growth in ACA Marketplace enrollment since 2020, the year before the enhanced premium tax credits became available, occurred in 3 of these states: Texas (2.8M), Florida (2.8M), and Georgia (1.0M).

Additional increases in the number of uninsured people in 2034 can also be attributable to the implementation of the finalized ACA Marketplace Integrity and Affordability rule. CBO has not released estimates for the finalized rule, so those effects are excluded from this analysis. In prior estimates, CBO allocated half of the 1.8 million increase in the uninsured due to the proposed Marketplace Integrity and Affordability rule to its baseline while they allocated the remainder into the Energy and Commerce section of the budget reconciliation bill. CMS estimates that in 2026, the finalized rule will lead to an increase in the number of uninsured people of between 725 thousand and 1.8 million. Many of the key provisions that impact enrollment processes will sunset at the end of 2026, so decreases in coverage from the rule in subsequent years are anticipated to be lower.

Methods

Increases in the number of uninsured were sourced from Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, separated into three groups: those newly uninsured because of changes in Medicaid, those newly uninsured because of changes in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, and others.

Changes in Medicaid: CBO estimates that changes in Medicaid from the budget law are expected to decrease the number of people with health insurance by 7.5 million in 2034, relative to estimated coverage prior to the bill’s enactment. The CBO estimates show the uninsured increases provision by provision and KFF allocates each provision’s increase across the states proportionally to that provision’s estimated reduction in federal Medicaid spending from a prior KFF analysis. Additional details are in the prior analysis but in general, changes that would affect the ACA expansion group only, including work requirements, are allocated across expansion states proportionally to federal spending among people eligible for the ACA expansion in FY 2024.  Provider tax provisions are allocated across the states using several steps that account for the different provider taxes states had in place prior to the bill’s enactment. Other provisions are allocated proportionally to states’ share of federal Medicaid spending in FY 2024. The sum of each provision’s increased in the number of uninsured people led to 8.0 million, which is more than the 7.5 million total, so each provision’s change was reduced by roughly 6% so that the provision-specific estimates would sum to 7.5 million. Data sources include:

KFF’s 2024 Budget Survey, Provider Rates and Taxes
KFF’s Which States Might Have to Reduce Provider Taxes Under the Senate Reconciliation Bill?

Changes in the ACA Marketplaces:  Increases in the uninsured population are taken from Congressional Budget Office estimates. Impacts of individual provisions within the budget reconciliation law are separately apportioned to calculate state-level estimates.

Provision	Allocation Method	Source
Tax credit restrictions for immigrants	Share of noncitizens with direct-purchase health insurance	KFF analysis of 2023 American Community Survey (ACS) data
Eligibility verification requirements	Share of 2025 Marketplace enrollment	Open Enrollment Period Public Use Files
Prohibiting tax credit eligibility for non-qualifying life event SEP enrollees	Share of low-income enrollment (at or below 150% FPL) excluding the District of Columbia and states with Basic Health Programs or equivalent (MN, NY, OR)	Open Enrollment Period Public Use Files
Eliminating limits on excess premium tax credit repayments	Share of 2025 Marketplace enrollment	Open Enrollment Period Public Use Files

Growth of the uninsured population due to the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits was allocated at the state level by share of growth in Marketplace enrollment between 2020 and 2025, based on the open enrollment period public use files. Due to rounding in the CBO estimates, increases in the uninsured due to individual provisions have been scaled to sum up to the totals provided by CBO.

Other Changes: The CBO estimates of changes in the number of uninsured people (relative to current law) include 0.1 million uninsured because of changes in Medicare and 0.3 million people uninsured because of interactions. Medicare-related changes are allocated proportionally to Medicare enrollment in 2024. Increases in the uninsured stemming from the interaction was split between Medicaid-related and ACA-related proportionally to each type’s chare of uninsured changes in CBO’s estimate (7.8 million for Medicaid and 2.1 million for ACA). Each change in the uninsured loss stemming from the interaction was allocated across states proportionally to each state’s share of the overall change.

Population Estimates: Decennial state-level population projections from the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service are used to interpolate the population in 2034 assuming compound population growth. The percentage point increase of the uninsured population per state reflects the estimated increase in the uninsured as a share of the projected population. The total impact from all changes were aggregated then rounded to two significant figures, with the percentage point increase in the uninsured population rounded to the nearest whole number.

These increases are attributable to the reconciliation law alone and do not include the effects of the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits or the proposed Marketplace integrity rule. In terms of increases in the number of uninsured people, California and New York are the top two states (1.6M and 860k, respectively). Florida, Texas, and Illinois would follow at 590k, 480k, and 470k, respectively. Figure 2

In 34 states and the District of Columbia, the uninsured rates could be 3 percentage points or more higher than would otherwise be the case. About half (49%) of the 14.2 million more people who would be uninsured in this scenario live in California (1.7M), Florida (1.5M), Texas (1.4M), New York (860k), Illinois (520k), Georgia (500k) and Ohio (460k). The largest growth in ACA Marketplace enrollment since 2020, the year before the enhanced premium tax credits became available, occurred in 3 of these states: Texas (2.8M), Florida (2.8M), and Georgia (1.0M). Additional increases in the number of uninsured people in 2034 can also be attributable to the implementation of the finalized ACA Marketplace Integrity and Affordability rule. CBO has not released estimates for the finalized rule, so those effects are excluded from this analysis. In prior estimates, CBO allocated half of the 1.8 million increase in the uninsured due to the proposed Marketplace Integrity and Affordability rule to its baseline while they allocated the remainder into the Energy and Commerce section of the budget reconciliation bill. CMS estimates that in 2026, the finalized rule will lead to an increase in the number of uninsured people of between 725 thousand and 1.8 million. Many of the key provisions that impact enrollment processes will sunset at the end of 2026, so decreases in coverage from the rule in subsequent years are anticipated to be lower. Increases in the number of uninsured were sourced from Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, separated into three groups: those newly uninsured because of changes in Medicaid, those newly uninsured because of changes in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, and others. Changes in Medicaid: CBO estimates that changes in Medicaid from the budget law are expected to decrease the number of people with health insurance by 7.5 million in 2034, relative to estimated coverage prior to the bill’s enactment. The CBO estimates show the uninsured increases provision by provision and KFF allocates each provision’s increase across the states proportionally to that provision’s estimated reduction in federal Medicaid spending from a prior KFF analysis. Additional details are in the prior analysis but in general, changes that would affect the ACA expansion group only, including work requirements, are allocated across expansion states proportionally to federal spending among people eligible for the ACA expansion in FY 2024.  Provider tax provisions are allocated across the states using several steps that account for the different provider taxes states had in place prior to the bill’s enactment. Other provisions are allocated proportionally to states’ share of federal Medicaid spending in FY 2024. The sum of each provision’s increased in the number of uninsured people led to 8.0 million, which is more than the 7.5 million total, so each provision’s change was reduced by roughly 6% so that the provision-specific estimates would sum to 7.5 million. Data sources include: Changes in the ACA Marketplaces:  Increases in the uninsured population are taken from Congressional Budget Office estimates. Impacts of individual provisions within the budget reconciliation law are separately apportioned to calculate state-level estimates. Provision	Allocation Method	Source
Tax credit restrictions for immigrants	Share of noncitizens with direct-purchase health insurance	KFF analysis of 2023 American Community Survey (ACS) data
Eligibility verification requirements	Share of 2025 Marketplace enrollment	Open Enrollment Period Public Use Files
Prohibiting tax credit eligibility for non-qualifying life event SEP enrollees	Share of low-income enrollment (at or below 150% FPL) excluding the District of Columbia and states with Basic Health Programs or equivalent (MN, NY, OR)	Open Enrollment Period Public Use Files
Eliminating limits on excess premium tax credit repayments	Share of 2025 Marketplace enrollment	Open Enrollment Period Public Use Files Growth of the uninsured population due to the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits was allocated at the state level by share of growth in Marketplace enrollment between 2020 and 2025, based on the open enrollment period public use files. Due to rounding in the CBO estimates, increases in the uninsured due to individual provisions have been scaled to sum up to the totals provided by CBO. Other Changes: The CBO estimates of changes in the number of uninsured people (relative to current law) include 0.1 million uninsured because of changes in Medicare and 0.3 million people uninsured because of interactions. Medicare-related changes are allocated proportionally to Medicare enrollment in 2024. Increases in the uninsured stemming from the interaction was split between Medicaid-related and ACA-related proportionally to each type’s chare of uninsured changes in CBO’s estimate (7.8 million for Medicaid and 2.1 million for ACA). Each change in the uninsured loss stemming from the interaction was allocated across states proportionally to each state’s share of the overall change. Population Estimates: Decennial state-level population projections from the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service are used to interpolate the population in 2034 assuming compound population growth. The percentage point increase of the uninsured population per state reflects the estimated increase in the uninsured as a share of the projected population. The total impact from all changes were aggregated then rounded to two significant figures, with the percentage point increase in the uninsured population rounded to the nearest whole number. Table 1

MIAMI — GOP lawmakers in the 10 states that refused the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion for over a decade have argued their conservative approach to growing government programs would pay off in the long run.

This story also ran on CBS News. It can be republished for free.

Instead, the Republican-passed budget law that includes many of President Donald Trump’s priorities will pose at least as big a burden on patients and hospitals in the expansion holdout states as in the 40 states that have extended Medicaid coverage to more low-income adults, hospital executives and other officials warn.

For instance, Georgia, with a population of just over 11 million, will see as many people lose insurance coverage sold through ACA marketplaces as will California, with more than triple the population, according to estimates by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

The new law imposes additional paperwork requirements on Obamacare enrollees, slashes the time they have each year to sign up, and cuts funding for navigators who help them shop for plans. Those changes, all of which will erode enrollment, are expected to have far more impact in states like Florida and Texas than in California because a higher proportion of residents in non-expansion states are enrolled in ACA plans.

The budget law, which Republicans called the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” will cause sweeping changes to health care across the country as it trims federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion over the next decade. The program covers more than 71 million people with low incomes and disabilities. Ten million people will lose coverage over the next decade due to the law, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

Many of its provisions are focused on the 40 states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA, which added millions more low-income adults to the rolls. But the consequences are not confined to those states. A proposal from conservatives to cut more generous federal payments for people added to Medicaid by the ACA expansion didn’t make it into the law.

“Politicians in non-expansion states should be furious about that,” said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

The number of people losing coverage could accelerate in non-expansion states if enhanced federal subsidies for Obamacare plans expire at the end of the year, driving up premiums as early as January and adding to the rolls of uninsured. KFF estimates as many as 2.2 million people could become uninsured just in Florida, a state where lawmakers refused to expand Medicaid and, partly as a result, now leads the nation in ACA enrollment.

For people like Francoise Cham of Miami, who has Obamacare coverage, the Republican policy changes could be life-altering.

Before she had insurance, the 62-year-old single mom said she would donate blood just to get her cholesterol checked. Once a year, she’d splurge for a wellness exam at Planned Parenthood. She expects to make about $28,000 this year and currently pays about $100 a month for an ACA plan to cover herself and her daughter, and even that strains her budget.

Cham choked up describing the “safety net” that health insurance has afforded her — and at the prospect of being unable to afford coverage if premiums spike at the end of the year.

“Obamacare has been my lifesaver,” she said.

If the enhanced ACA subsidies aren’t extended, “everyone will be hit hard,” said Cindy Mann, a health policy expert with Manatt Health, a consulting and legal firm, and a former deputy administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

“But a state that hasn’t expanded Medicaid will have marketplace people enrolling at lower income levels,” she said. “So, a greater share of residents are reliant on the marketplace.”

Though GOP lawmakers may try to cut Medicaid even more this year, for now the states that expanded Medicaid largely appear to have made a smart decision, while states that haven’t are facing similar financial pressures without any upside, said health policy experts and hospital industry observers.

KFF Health News reached out to the governors of the 10 states that have not fully expanded Medicaid to see if the budget legislation made them regret that decision or made them more open to expansion. Spokespeople for Republican Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina and Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia did not indicate whether their states are considering Medicaid expansion.

Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for McMaster’s office, said South Carolina’s Medicaid program focuses on “low-income children and families and disabled individuals,” adding, “The state’s Medicaid program does not anticipate a large impact on the agency’s Medicaid population.”

Enrollment in ACA marketplace plans nationwide has more than doubled since 2020 to 24.3 million. If enhanced subsidies expire, premiums for Obamacare coverage would rise by more than 75% on average, according to an analysis by KFF. Some insurers are already signaling they plan to charge more.

The CBO estimates that allowing enhanced subsidies to expire will increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million by 2034, compared with a permanent extension. That would come on top of the coverage losses caused by Trump’s budget law.

“That is problematic and scary for us,” said Eric Boley, president of the Wyoming Hospital Association.

He said his state, which did not expand Medicaid, has a relatively small population and hasn’t been the most attractive for insurance providers — few companies currently offer plans on the ACA exchange — and he worried any increase in the uninsured rate would “collapse the insurance market.”

As the uninsured rate rises in non-expansion states and the budget law’s Medicaid cuts loom, lawmakers say state funds will not backfill the loss of federal dollars, including in states that have refused to expand Medicaid.

Those states got slightly favorable treatment under the law, but it’s not enough, said Grace Hoge, press secretary for Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat who favors Medicaid expansion but who has been rebuffed by GOP state legislators.

“Kansans’ ability to access affordable healthcare will be harmed,” Hoge said in an email. “Kansas, nor our rural hospitals, will not be able to make up for these cuts.”

For hospital leaders in other states that have refused full Medicaid expansion, the budget law poses another test by limiting financing arrangements states leveraged to make higher Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals.

Beginning in 2028, the law will reduce those payments by 10 percentage points each year until they are closer to what Medicare pays.

Richard Roberson, president of the Mississippi Hospital Association, said the state’s use of what’s called directed payments in 2023 helped raise its Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals and other health institutions from $500 million a year to $1.5 billion a year. He said higher rates helped Mississippi’s rural hospitals stay open.

“That payment program has just been a lifeline,” Roberson said.

The budget law includes a $50 billion fund intended to insulate rural hospitals and clinics from its changes to Medicaid and the ACA. But a KFF analysis found it would offset only about one-third of the cuts to Medicaid in rural areas.

Trump encouraged Florida, Tennessee, and Texas to continue refusing Medicaid expansion in his first term, when his administration gave them an unusual 10-year extension for financing programs known as uncompensated care pools, which generate billions of dollars to pay hospitals for treating the uninsured, said Allison Orris, director of Medicaid policy for the left-leaning think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

“Those were very clearly a decision from the first Trump administration to say, ‘You get a lot of money for an uncompensated care pool instead of expanding Medicaid,’” she said.

Those funds are not affected by Trump’s new tax-and-spending law. But they do not help patients the way insurance coverage would, Orris said. “This is paying hospitals, but it’s not giving people health care,” she said. “It’s not giving people prevention.”

States such as Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi have not only turned down the additional federal funding that Medicaid expansion brings, but most of the remaining non-expansion states spend less than the national average per Medicaid enrollee, provide fewer or less generous benefits, and cover fewer categories of low-income Americans.

Mary Mayhew, president of the Florida Hospital Association, said the state’s Medicaid program does not adequately cover children, older people, and people with disabilities because reimbursement rates are too low.

“Children don’t have timely access to dentists,” she said. “Expectant moms don’t have access nearby to an OB-GYN. We’ve had labor and delivery units close in Florida.”

She said the law will cost states more in the long run.

“The health care outcomes for the individuals we serve will deteriorate,” Mayhew said. “That’s going to lead to higher cost, more spending, more dependency on the emergency department.”
