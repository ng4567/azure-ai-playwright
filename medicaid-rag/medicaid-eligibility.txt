Am I Eligible for Medicaid?
Being eligible for Medicaid depends on your income level, age, family size, and if you are pregnant or a person with a disability.

Your child may be eligible for Medicaid even if you are not. Learn more about Maryland Children’s Health Program (MCHP).

The only way to know for sure if you or your child are eligible for Medicaid or MCHP is to apply. You can apply at any time.
